nb embark order

Assign bookkeeper, broker, manager, and militia commander.
Only use dyed thread and cloth in workshops.

Early carpenter makes beds, barrels, bins and buckets.  Early crafter
makes rock pots.  Early mason makes tables and thrones.  Early kitchen
makes easy and fine meals.

At embark, mine features of rock walls, looking deeper passages to
frames, or a 3-wide passage to a depot.  Where enough mined space,
build (mason|crafter|jeweler)+ workshop(s) to quickly produce items.
When a passage earns a chamber, or is deep enough to be a tomb,
build a mechanic workshop to set up mechanism-lever and drawbridge
of that material (connecting mechanisms can be made of anything).

Clear-cut trees and gather all plants.  Build carpenter’s workshop,
wood burner, and walled-and-bridged above-ground farm, leading to
first below-ground farm.

Build a chair of the most unusally-colored stone for the record-keeper:
the first throne of the fortress.

Once done with the surface mining, dig down to magma to set up a metal
industry.  Drawbridge both ends of the staircase, as well as the magma
burrow with two levels, lower for magma furnaces and forges, and the
upper for beds and stockpiles.

Plan the social burrow behind a waterfall behind grates or fortifications.

nb flood trap

Wild creatures travel no faster than 400, which is 4 turns and then
a movement turn.  So the fastest creatures can travel 100/5=20 tiles
in 100 turns.

At time 0, enemy steps on pressure plate 'p'.
	At time 5, the fastest wild enemy is 1 square away.
	At time 10, the fastest wild enemy is 2 squares away.
	At time 100, the fastest wild enemy is 21 squares away.
	A drawbridge 25 squares away should always have time to close.
	A second drawbridge, as far before the pressure plate as you
care to trap enemies, should be linked to either the same plate or
another plate 'P' right next to the first plate.
	The overseer may flood the tunnel from above at leisure, closing
first the drawbridge after the floor grate, then the hatch below the
floor grate, and opening the hatches above the pressure plates.
Once enemies drown, drain trap into cavern via hole(s) in its ceiling.
	Have pressure plates deconstruct so trap will not open on its own.
	Building destroyers could destroy the grate (items goto cavern)
and maybe the hatch below it (trap won’t fill), so keep them on the
wrong side of the drawbridge so the trap will always fill.
	To reset the trap after drain, first open it up by constructing
a lever and connecting it to the second drawbridge.  While looting the
trap content, recreate the pressure plates.

Bah.  This won’t work becase the stupid pressure plates send "open"
not "close" to the drawbridges.

Looks like it's all about a far drop from a retracting bridge.

Or better yet, weapon traps, which just work, and are a more reliable
weapon delivery system than dwarves.  Use dull weapons though, no need
to create an undead army.  Also use foreign weapons (whips!).
Forbid mechanism or corpse so mechanic won’t clear during seige.
