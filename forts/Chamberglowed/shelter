nb shelter plan

Fishery by stream for expedition leader.  Each other dwarf needs to
use full complement of skills in areas of expertise.  Metalsmith needs
to burn wood.

Pastures for poultry with nest boxes; midsize animals with a farmer’s
workshop; and double-size for ridable grazers of burden.

First, dig rings for each level to get at stone quickly.

Initial shelter: (0) Walled outside workshops: carpenter, trade depot,
wood burner; butcher, tanner, leatherworker, animal training zone.
(1) Inside farm with still, kitchen, farmer’s workshop, and querns,
screw presses, and record keeper’s chair.  (2) Wagon-pile storeroom.
(3) Stone chamber.  (4) Metal chamber.  (5) Dining room, meeting hall.
(6) 7 bedrooms, 3x3 dorm, mini-hospital.  (7) Cistern.

Then each expansion gets its own burrow or chamber, all spread out.

Wall outside farm.

Trade burrow: Surface 3x1 ramps to 3x3 for drawbridge to 3x3 for traps
to 3x3 for drawbridge to trade depot and barracks.

Chief medical dwarf does all healthcare tasks, and hauls items,
corpses for burial, food, and refuse.
