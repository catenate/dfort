251 Granite.  On the planet of enchantment, in the banded land,
we found a place of high cliffs around a river valley border between
the Finger of Reining and the Jungle of Princes.  The Finger is
untamed temperate wilds on a mountain with no trees, thick other
vegetation, and the brook Flax of Fire.  At the site we should find
shallow metals, deep metal, and flux stone.  The Jungle is temperate
heavy conifer forest with thick other vegetation, and the brook Flax
of Fire.  Inside we should find clay, deep soil, deep metals, and flux
stone.  Only goblins as possible neighbors of this outpost Tubeletters
of the Ceiling of Gleams.
