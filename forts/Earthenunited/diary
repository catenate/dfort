Diary of Ïngiz Diamondfolded, first-migrant planter, The Folded Banner.

253 Sandstone.  Knighthold the Velvet Slaughter, an undead two-hump
camel skeleton, or the ensuing panic, killed Rakust, Eshtân, Zasit,
Deler, Ilral, and Shorast, as well as a water buffalo calf, turkey gobbler,
three stray dogs, and the dog Åmdoren.  Erush, Tun, and Ïteb are missing,
presumed dead.  Our new expedition leader, Ber Paintsqueezed,
is unconscious but unharmed, and Mebzuth is pale and damaged.
No medical talent or hospital burrow, so Mebzuth may not survive.
15 drink of 334 total food, for 6 dwarves and 22 animals.
Need to assess remaining talent and reassign work.
