Medical journal of Vucar Crystalstraps, fourth-migrant chief medical dwarf, The Folded Banner.

254 Galena.  Other than a few hungry dwarves, the only medical case is
that of Ilral Channelstandards, who lost the ability to stand, and
requires a crutch.  Ilral was brought to rest in the barracks bed by
the cook Îton.

255 Malachite.  We must set up a hospital to give proper care to Ùshrir’s
infected, smashed hands and feet.  He is also unconscious and starving,
with no food or well nearby.  All because of some blundered work on
the water system.  I was able to clean him, but without a hospital and
everyone busy, I will have to do all I can myself to help people.
My husband Degël said he would try to do everything he can to help me—
I know he’s better at setting bones, at least.
	Degël did a good job on Ùshrir’s left foot and right hand.
Now Ùshrir just needs cleaned and dressed.

Limestone.  The hospital is being restored!  And a soapmaker’s
workshop is being installed nearby!
