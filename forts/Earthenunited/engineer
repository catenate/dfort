255 Galena.  The water that is covering the mechanisms for the hospital
cistern is not rising to the level of the hospital because the 1-wide
water tunnel does not generate enough pressure to raise it that high.
To uncover the mechanisms, we would have to dig a spillway at the
level of the mechanisms, lowering the water enough to raise the
drawbridge to the water tunnel.
	Well, that didn’t work.  It’s filling the larger chamber without
reducing the depth of water in the tunnel.
	If we do not increase the width of the tunnel, increasing its
pressure, then the water should not raise above its current level,
however broad it spreads.  So we should be able to start using the
“threatened” chambers.
	The lesson here is a very large deep cistern will not
necessarily fill up to the level of the original water source.
