nb 11x11 isolate burrow drawbridge plan

Each burrow decides which other burrows to trust,
of the burrows to which it is connected.
Name burrows after the mined-out veins which lead to them.

nb toss throw slam goblin tumble drawbridge siege defense

To load the Goblin Tumbler, invite the vile forces of darkness down
the stairs and into into the tunnel, by opening all but the innermost
bridge (4).  When a good selection of goblins are present, close the
outermost bridge (1) so no-one misses out on the fun, or leaves the
party early.  Select one of (2) or (3) to close, depending on where
any heavy enemies stand (eg rutherers).  The bridge you select should
support only relatively light enemies, but as many of them as you like.
Let’s call them squad 2 standing on drawbridge 2, squad 3 standing on
drawbridge 3.  Bring together squads 2 and 3 by closing e.g. bridge 2,
launching squad 2 bodily down the tunnel to bludgeon squad 3 (including
any heavy hostiles), with their bodies in armor, puncture and lacerate
them with their weapons, and slam any others into bridge 4.  At this
point both squads are on bridge 3.  Open bridge 2 to attract survivors
with promise of retreat.  If the heavy moves off bridge 3, close
bridge 3 to launch dead bodies and fallen weapons at the survivors.
Otherwise, keep launching whatever moves from bridge 2 towards bridge 4.
Repeat until nothing survives.  Open inner bridge 4 and loot at leisure,
or leave shrapnel in for future parties.

Since this design consumes no resources other than stone (blocks),
build as many as you like without worrying about water or magma flow,
or cleaning and resetting traps.

nb network

First stair: first set of chambers and the first staircase from top
to bottom.

Defense: barracks, weapon and armor producers, defensive works,
hospital.

Food: farms, outside, caverns.

Stone: mines, masons, mechanics, stonecrafters, jewelers.

Each network has an entire level devoted to its interconnections, so
in the most centralized case, each chamber sends a path to the inter-
connect level, and this level takes care of tying them all together.
One drawbridge per network connected, interconnects can be widened
for a lot of traffic.

In the most disconnected case, every chamber has a unique connection
to each other it directly needs.  One drawbridge per chamber connected,
have to dig separate tunnel for each pair of chambers connected.
Can accommodate the shortest path between two chambers.

A middle approach is to reuse existing paths of the network wherever
possible.  Mining and pathing cost vs.  extra travel distance.


nb start order mine chamber

As general procedure, first mine the trade depot (chamber 1: trade
depot, first temporary workshops: carpenter, mason, mechanic, still,
kitchen; simplify by removing temporary workshops; expand with shops
to make trade goods) and be able to close it up with a bridge.  On the
other side of the trade depot, out of soil and far enough away to put
between them both drawbridges and connections to other chambers, mine
a tunnel down to a storeroom (chamber 2: piles; expand with more of
the same) to unload the wagon.  On the other side of the storeroom,
mine a tunnel further down to a lounge (chamber 3: dorms, mini-hospital,
dining room and meeting hall, pile food and drink; expand with real
hospital, dining room, statuary, zoo), which should eventually be
above a cistern.  On the other side of the lounge, mine back up to an
inside farm (chamber 4: demolish kitchen and still in trade area;
expand with outside walled farm and a nearby soil farm).  From the
lounge, mine down to stone chamber (chamber 5: jeweler, mason,
mechanic, stonecrafter, wood burner, forge, smelter; expand with
mines, shop levels with bedrooms).  Expand borders of every chamber to
mine veins.  Fill veins with coffins.  At end of veins, more chambers
(of different type, or same type to avoid too many 4-X layers) behind
drawbridges.

Pasture can be larger and unwalled, the animals were largely
unaffected by the seige.


nb burrow name plan

Spread-out nuclei of burrows, and extra levels.  Three-part name of
burrow: first name of primary dwarf who founded the burrow; purpose of
burrow; word for chamber (mafol, usually ommitted).  Each burrow can
also have lower levels for stockpiles of items which overflow their
production areas.  Patron statue in alcove named in honor of chamber.
Keep diaries for each burrow with cast, leader, ledger, manager, plan.
	Sunshine burrow (${carpenter} Admafol): fishery by river;
carpenter/wood burner/bowyer; walled outside butcher/tanner/
leatherworker; kennel by pastures?
	Tradecrafter burrow (${broker} Nishmafol): Trade depot and barracks;
workshops and piles for desired trade items.
	Shelter burrow (${doctor} Ekastmafol): Wagon piles (seed, food, drink,
weapons, armor); starting 7+2 dedicated beds, 9-bed dorm, mini-hospital,
dining room and meeting hall, food/drink; hospital.
	Farm burrow (${brewer} Ivommafol): inside; walled outside; irrigated inside.
	Stone burrow (${mechanic} Lammafol).
	Metal burrow (${weaponsmith} Kelmafol); bar stockpile.
	Social burrow (${mayor} Rethalmafol): dining room and meeting hall;
pile prepared meals; statuary; zoo.
	Barracks burrow (${captain} Ezarmafol); armory.

nb burrow connections

Dig an 11x11 chamber in the ground near the resources it uses.
Put in the workshops needed now, and drawbridge its entrance.
Exit out the other side of the chamber to get to the next one,
and drawbridge the exit.  Tunnel to the next set of resources,
and repeat.

Also connect directly back to any previous chamber whose contents are
directly used, drawbridging both ends of the new connecting tunnel.

Drawbridge-seal connections not in use.  Both sides need to agree
to lower drawbridges to reconnect, so one compromised chamber does not
give access to the other.  Do not centralize these: takes longer to
seal them all, but no central point of failure.

Definitely distribute food and drink to the bedrooms, to avoid sealed
dwarves starving if no access to shelter.

Some connection tunnels may used by one of the two chambers it
connects, without that chamber wanting connection to the other chamber
For example, farm tunnels to magma burrow, with magma workshops on one
level and piles and bedrooms on the other.  The magma burrow wants to
use the tunnel to mine, but doesn’t want the farm chamber, and the
farm chamber doesn’t want the magma chamber.  In this case, the farm
should drawbridge off the tunnel at its wall, the magma chamber should
also drawbridge off the tunnel at its wall (so far, so normal), and in
addition the magma chamber should wall off the tunnel just before the
farm-wall drawbridge, so if the farm is compromised it doesn’t
compromise the mine.  Come to think of it, the mine should have a
drawbridge to the magma burrow too, in case it gets flooded with magma
we don’t lose the mine.  Essentially, set up two-way drawbridge
chokepoints at every interesting division between portions of the
fortress, such as between chambers, between chambers and big features
such as caverns and the surface, and between sections of large
features such as a grand staircase.
